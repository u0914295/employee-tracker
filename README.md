# employee-tracker

## Description
My motivation for building this project was to put to use the newly acquired skills I learned about databases and servers through MySQL and MySQL Workbench. I built this project to make as an example of a database that could be used at companies to better manage their employee information and layout of the organization. This includes information such as the first and last name of the employees, the departments of the organization, and the roles each employee currently possesses along with their salary. This solves the problem of losing track of all the employees in the organization and keeps it up to date when a new employee is hired or let go. It also lets the accounting department of the organization have a better grasp of the roles and salaries of each individual employee. From building this project, I learned the importance of databases and how powerful they are when it comes to organizing information.

## Installation
To install the database, one must first set up a server with MySQL. Once done, import the database.sql file into MySQL Workbench and note the server information as it will be needed. Copy the server information (host, port, user, password, and database) into the index.js file. Now, you're ready to go! Open the file containing all the code downloaded from this repository. Once inside the file using file explorer, click on the file address and enter the "cmd". This will open up the command prompt where you will then enter the commands to run the program. Once "cmd" is open, download the node dependencies by typing "node install". Once the dependencies are installed, type the command "node index.js". This will start the database program!

## Usage

Once you've started the database program, your screen should look as follows:

Browse through the various tabs to view all the departments in the workplace, view all the roles of the workplace, and view all the employees in the workplace. You can also add a department, add a new role, and add or remove an employee. Keep in mind when adding or removing an employee, you must hit "enter" on the "Update employee role" tab.
